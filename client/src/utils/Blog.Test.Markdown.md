As the technology industry is booming globally, the demand for skilled programmers has sky rocketed. With a constant demand, and high potential incomes, they career choice is becoming a great option for many people entering the workforce, as well as those looking to make a career shift into an exiting and growing industry.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Historically, programming has had a high portion of self-taught professionals with no formal computer science specific degree's. However in recent years, the popularity of computer science degrees have increased. Stack Overflow's 2019 Developer Survey indicates 60.4% of those who completed an undergraduate degree had studied a computer science related degree (49.1% of all professional developers surveyed had completed a bachelor's degree).

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Nowadays, the pathway to learn how to code generally falls within the following categories:

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

1.  Computer Science Degree
2.  Bootcamp
3.  Self Taught

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Pro's and con's of each pathway is outlined below:

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Computer Science Degree

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

<img class="blog-content-img-medium" src="https://i.imgur.com/2hGRF1G.png" />

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Pros

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Accreditation:** achieving a computer science related degree will provide you with an accredited certificate of competency. Many large companies require a computer science (or related) degree for applicants, especially for Junior Positions. Having an accredited degree may put you ahead of other candidates with similar experience levels.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Thorough:** a degree will provide you with a thorough overview of core computer science fundamental knowledge that may not be part of a Bootcamp, or self taught pathway. You will have the opportunity to take elective subjects and pursue knowledge in areas that interest you.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Networking:** attending a University will give you the opportunity to network with people in similar position to yourself, and give you face to face exposure. The saying "it's not what you know, but who you know" holds true in all industries and can put you one step ahead in applying for your next role.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Corporate Partnerships:** many Universities partner with corporates in sponsored events such as hackathons.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Cons

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Expensive:** Universities typically will cost a significant amount of money (especially when you are able to self-teach for no cost). Depending of location, and level of Government support, undergraduate degree's in computer science can cost upwards tens of thousands of dollars.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Slow:** typically an undergraduate degree in computer science would require at least 3 years of full time study, and significantly longer if you undertake part time study, or fail subjects.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Practical Relevance:** despite being a thorough overview of fundamental computer science concepts, computer science degree's cover such a depth of knowledge, that some feel the practical coding experience can be lacking (especially experience with modern technologies/frameworks)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Bootcamp

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

<img class="blog-content-img-medium" src="https://i.imgur.com/F9I44Ci.png" />

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Pros

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Concise:** Bootcamps fit a condensed version of a computer science degree into a 2-3 month period. Many also provide online coursework that enables you to complete the Bootcamp remotely.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Practical:** Bootcamps generally focus on specific languages or technology stacks, and their practical implementation with real world projects.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Networking:** many Bootcamps also partner with corporates, and host networking events with the goal to promote hiring of the Bootcamp graduates.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Cons

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Market Perception:** Some view Coding Bootcamps are teaching you to code but skipping out on the fundamental understanding of what you are actually doing. The goal of a coding bootcamp is to give you the minimum set of skills necessary to get a job writing basic software. This may mean recruiters/hiring managers perceive you as having a knowledge "gap".

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Expensive:** typically coding Bootcamps cost thousands of dollars, which can be a very expensive option, especially when obtaining a University degree may enable some level of Government support of loan (which coding Bootcamps don't provide you).

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Core Knowledge:** as Bootcamps are generally an "accelerated" course in practical technology stack, many feel there is focus on practical skill while skipping the underlying core theory. This may put you at a disadvantage when talking with hiring managers/recruiters.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Variable Quality:** it is hard to ensure the Bootcamp you attend will provide valuable experience, as Bootcamps generally have low barriers to entry, and have spent significant resources into marketing how great they are (whereas the reality may be different)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Self Taught

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

<img class="blog-content-img-medium" src="https://i.imgur.com/oYrOA5v.png" />

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Pros

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Cheaper** Perhaps the biggest benefit of self teaching is you can learn to code for free. The internet has plentiful resources on computer science fundamentals, and free courses for learning new technologies/frameworks.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Flexible Timing** When learning to code yourself, you can fit it into your own schedule and allocate time wherever suits. This also relies on you being a self motivated learner

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Up to date curriculum** Universities, and to a lesser extent Coding Bootcamps, are slower to adapt to newer technologies and curriculum. Whereas, self learning has the benefit of flexible scope and you are able to learn whatever technology/curriculum that you choose.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Cons

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Limited Networking:** teaching yourself to code can be a very difficult and you do not have easy direct access to collaborate/learn from others on the same pathway as you. Many online resources eg. StackOverflow, reddit, Dev.to, HackerNooon etc. are available to collaborate online - however the face to face networking provided by University/Bootcamps is very hard to replicate

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Hard to Obtain Practical Experience:** due to the huge amount of resources online, and no barrier to entry, there is a huge amount of courses/tutorials that are subpar and do not provide you with practical "real world" examples. Many instead chose over-simplified code and shortcuts instead of best practice.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Unstructured:** Teaching yourself means there is no set structure or KPIs to your learning. You may find yourself lost trying to decide on what new technology/framework/project to work on, especially if you have limited practical knowledge and background.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Requires Self Motivation:** while self teaching offers a great deal of flexibility that the other options may not, people who choose to go down the path of self teaching to code are often working full time in fields that may be unrelated to technology. This means life can easily get in the way of dedicating the required time to advance your computer science knowledge and skill set. Pursuing a bootcamp or University degree generally requires up to 20hrs - 40hrs of time per week dedicated to study. For someone self-teaching, and working full time, to match the same time allocation would be close to impossible.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Market Perception:** Similar to Boot camps, hiring managers/recruits can view self taught developers as having questionable knowledge and experience. Without practical experience on your resume, you will likely be at a disadvantage over other candidates who have a University degree or real world experience.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Conclusion

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Every pathway listed above has pros/cons that may suit your position, lifestyle, and budget. Each can enable you to start a long term career in software development.
