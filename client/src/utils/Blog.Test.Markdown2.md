For many people who are starting to progress in their careers, and earn enough income to begin saving for their future, a frequent question is _how much should I be saving?_

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Before setting a saving target you should be asking yourself a few questions:

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**1. Do I have any debt I need to pay off?**

&nbsp;

**2. What am I saving for?**

&nbsp;

**3. Are there any large expenses that I need to budget for?**

&nbsp;

**4. How much security do I have in my current income?**

&nbsp;

**5. How much will I be earning in the future?**

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

A general rule of thumb is to first pay off any debt you have oustanding. There are many suggestions on how to prioritise paying off your debts, but a good rule of thumb is to pay off the debt in decscending order according to which has the highest interest rates.

## The 50 / 30 / 20 rule

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

A popular rule that has emerged amoungst those looking to adopt a quick and easy budgeting guideline in the 50 / 30 / 20 rule. Under this rule, you post tax income is split as follows:

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **50% for living expenses:** this covers your day to day expenses that are necessary to maintain a decent quality of life. Example of living expenses can be rent, bills/utilities, health insurance, groceries, gym memberships, and travel expenses.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **30% for discretionary spending:** this covers non essential spending on things including new clothes, take away food, holidays, and going out.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **20% for savings:** this portion of your income is to be saved away for long term savings, and investments

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

While this may seem like an easy target to achieve, when you actually go through your weekly expenses and tally every dollar spent, many people find they are spending much more than they estimated.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Hints for increasing your savings

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Make a budget you can stick to:** one of the biggest problems people face when starting a new budget is creating a budget that is so strict, they never have a chance to keep to it. If you set something too strict, then as soon as you deviate from your target, your entire strategy goes out the window.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Consistency is key:** even if you are unable to keep to your savings target every single week and month, a consistent long term savings strategy will still benefit you in the long run. A realistic long term strategy is key to achieving your savings goal.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Keep track of your savings goal:** once you've comfortably started savings, a useful tool to see your savings grow is the [flogs.me compounding savings calculator](https://flogs.me/tools#compound)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

In the above scenario a $5,000 per year contribution to savings for 30 years, compounding at a 5.0% return, will give you $353,812.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

From this example, and following the 50 / 30 / 20 guidelines from earlier, someone with an income of 25,000 after tax should be able to achieve that savings target within 30 years. If you are living in a capital city, where salaries are generally higher, your savings target can greatly improve with higher recurring savings contributions.
