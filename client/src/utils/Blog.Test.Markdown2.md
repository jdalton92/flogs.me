Learning to code can be a daunting challenge for many people, especially if you do not come from an analytical background, or have no previous software experience. However, there are fundamental similarities between many languages, as well as core computer science concepts that are important to master prior to specialising in a specific technology.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Programming paradigms describe they way in which the structure, elements, and logic of computer programs work. These do not describe a specific programming language but rather a programming methodology. Programming paradigms make it easier for humans to understand, read, and write programming code. If you are studying computer science, it is important to understand the fundamentals of some of the most common programming approaches and paradigms as it will enable a core understanding of the fundamental basis of many technologies, as well as use cases and benefits/limitations. Typically, there are two defined approaches that generally accepted as the main way in which programming is fundamentally applied.

# Types of Programming Approaches

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**1. Imperative Programming**

&nbsp;

Imperative programming defines control flow with statements, and uses these statements to change a program's state. This means imperative programming languages have explicit loops that can change variables within each loop, and the order in which the individual statements is executed is controlled.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**2. Declarative Programming**

&nbsp;

Declarative programming defines program logic, but does not detail control flow. This means the order in which the statements are executed is not directly defined. Not defining the control flow is to focus on the _what_, rather than the _how_, a program is implemented

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Within the 2 approaches summarised above, there are multiple programming paradigms, with the main three defined as follows;

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**- Procedural Programming**

&nbsp;

Procedural programming boils down to a series of steps that are performed sequentially. These are commonly referred to as procedures (also called subroutines, or functions). These are done in a specific order, and tend to implement solutions in a logical, linear fashion. Everything is achieved in the form of an instruction such as loop statements, if-else clauses, functions and sub-routines. These procedures can work on any record, which differs from Object Oriented Programming that has certain methods attached to objects.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**- Object-Oriented Programming**

&nbsp;

The fundamental unit in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is the "object". An object is a set of data and logic stored in a bundle. Objects can contain further objects, and can contain information makes makes use of objects and gives functionality, or methods, that allow them to perform specific actions. These methods are specifically attached to the object, and for this reason are not referred to as functions. Many programming language make use of OOP with other paradigms, which enable to use of both methods, functions, and classes.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**- Functional Programming**

&nbsp;

Functional programming treats programming as the mathematical evaluation of a function, which is stateless, and does not use mutable data. Stateless refers to the programming functions as not being sensitive to the state of the computation. This means if you call the function twice it will always return the exact same result.

The confusing part of defining programming paradigms is that many technologies allow you to mix paradigms. Despite this, a fundamental understanding of the popular programming paradigms is of benefit to becoming a better software engineer.
