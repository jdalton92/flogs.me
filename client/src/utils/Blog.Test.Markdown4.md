The software development lifecycle (SDLC) represents the generally accepted pathway and phases to developing software. It covers the life cycle of planning to testing and deploying software systems and products.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

The aim of adopting the SDLC in software development is to better meet customer expectations, with clearly defined phases of development. Many modern development environments have their roots from traditional SDLC, such as agile and devops.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Different theory outlines varying steps in the SDLC, however to core principles remain the same, whereby the phases of software development are split as summarised below:

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

# Software Development Life Cycle Phases

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**1. Planning:** typically a software product will be addressing an issue, solve and inefficiency, or improve upon a current solution. The planning phase of the SDLC will determine what the development process is looking to address.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**2. Requirements:** the requiremnts phase enables the detail design and the function of the software to be gathered Typically this will involve input from various stakeholders and ...

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**3. Design and Prototyping:** this phase enables detail on the overall look and feel of the software solution, and may include detail on views, business logic, process diagrams, as well as prototype or proof of concept software products to establish prelimary software architecture. Typically the prototyping will act as the base codebase for the next phase of software development

&nbsp;

**3. Software Development:**

&nbsp;

**4. Testing:** testing is used to pickup errors, bugs, and "features". There are various testing methods with the some of the most common being:

&nbsp;

_- unit testing:_ tesing of individual components of the software

&nbsp;

_- integration testing:_ combining of different modules, or project components, and testing as a group

&nbsp;

_- security testing:_ looking for vulnerabilities in things such as data security, and user privaledges. This also involves structuring code to prevent malicious attacks from intruders and unwanted users

&nbsp;

_- end to end (E2E) testing:_ this involves testing the software across the whole end user work flow from start to finish. This is used to test that data is accurately maintained across various states, and the any transformations are expected as expected

&nbsp;

_- user acceptance testing:_ sometimes called beta testing involves testing the prototype product, or development, with end users to gain feedback on suitability, user functionality and any bugs encountered

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Typically there are software libraries that enable testing within a CLI, or separate frameworks for more intensive testing (such as [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for E2E testing JavaScript applications).

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Testing generally occurs in a development environment that may use testing servers, databases, and users, to enable better debugging and error handling for the developers. The development and testing phases usually enables a production environment ready for the next phase of the SDLC.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**4. Implementation:** the software is put into production and run

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**5. Deployment:**

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**6. Operations and Maintenance:**
